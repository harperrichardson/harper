<h2 data-menu-item="true" class="h2-biggest">More Online Brokers</h2>

<p>Outside of our top seven online brokers for 2020, there are eight other brokerages we reviewed: Ally Invest, Firstrade, Chase You Invest Trade, SogoTrade, Robinhood, ChoiceTrade, Lightspeed, and Cobra Trading. Here's our high-level takeaways for each broker. To dive deeper, read our full review.</p>

<p><b>8. Ally Invest</b>, "Backed by Ally Financial, Ally Invest is a low-cost broker providing $0 stock and ETF trades. Ally’s complete universal-account management experience and easy to use website makes the brokerage great for current Ally Bank customers and everyday investors alike." <a href="/review/ally-invest">Read full review</a></p>

<p><b>9. Firstrade</b>, "Firstrade offers $0 stock, ETF, and options trades, and is best known for its easy-to-use website, alongside its Chinese language services. While Firstrade offers Morningstar research and a variety of tools, its overall offering struggles to stand out against household name brands who are also priced at $0." <a href="/review/firstrade">Read full review</a></p>

<p><b>10. Chase You Invest Trade</b>, "Chase You Invest Trade provides current Chase Bank customers a convenient way to invest in the stock market. While Chase doesn't provide all the bells and whistles like some of its non-bank competitors, our testing found the site to be easy to use and reliable overall." <a href="/review/chase-you-invest-trade">Read full review</a></p>

<p><b>11. SogoTrade</b>, "SogoTrade is an online discount brokerage that charges $4.88 base commissions and supports Chinese-speaking customers. Unfortunately, in a world where $0 trades are the baseline, despite offering five trading platforms for stocks and options, SogoTrade struggles to stand out." </p>

<p><b>12. Robinhood</b>, "Robinhood used to shine thanks to its easy-to-use mobile app and $0 trades. However, today, all of the largest online brokers offer free stock and ETF trades. As a result, it is much more difficult for Robinhood to outduel the competition." <a href="/review/robinhood">Read full review</a></p>

<p><b>13. ChoiceTrade</b>, "While ChoiceTrade advertises free stock trades, unfortunately, monthly costs add up, and, overall, ChoiceTrade provides customers an online investing experience not worth the hassle." </p>

<p><b>14. Lightspeed</b>, "Lightspeed is a direct-access online brokerage that focuses on serving active and professional traders through its in-house and third-party trading platforms. Casual traders beware, not trading enough means paying high monthly platform fees." <a href="/review/lightspeedtrading">Read full review</a></p>

<p><b>15. Cobra Trading</b>, "Cobra Trading was founded in 2003 by Chadd Hessing as a direct-access, low-cost online brokerage for professional stock traders. While Cobra Trading offers multiple trading platforms and personalized service, trading costs are more expensive than leader Interactive Brokers." </p>




<h2 data-menu-item="true" class="h2-biggest">2020 Category Winners</h2>

<p>For the StockBrokers.com 2020 Online Broker Review, all online broker participants were assessed on 236 different variables across eight Core categories. 3,540 data points were collected in total. Here are the 2020 Core category winners. <a href="/how-we-test">Here's how we tested</a>.</p>

<h2 data-menu-item="true" class="h2-biggest">2020 Overall Ranking</h2>

<p>Here's the Overall rankings for the 15 online brokers who participated in our 2020 Broker Review, sorted by Overall ranking.</p>

<p><a class="picture" href="https://cdn.stockbrokers.com/uploads/emnl2mp/online-stock-broker-rankings-2020.png"><img src="https://cdn.stockbrokers.com/uploads/emnl2mp/online-stock-broker-rankings-2020.png" alt="StockBrokers.com online stock broker rankings 2020" title="StockBrokers.com online stock broker rankings 2020"><br><small>StockBrokers.com online stock broker rankings 2020</small></a></p>

<p><i>Note: Robinhood does not offer phone support for customers. As a result, Robinhood shows "Not Rated" for Customer Service. To calculate an Overall rating, the points allocated to Customer Service were proportionally allocated to the remaining categories.</i></p>


<h2 class="h2-biggest">How do I choose an online brokerage?</h2>

<p>When selecting a new online broker, the first step is to read reviews and see what features matter most to you. Are low-cost trade commissions most important? What about customer service, the trading platform, mobile app, investment research, ease of use, or education? With many brokers specializing in different areas, it is crucial to evaluate all categories by reading <a href="/review">full-length broker reviews</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">How do I assess trading costs?</h2>

<p>When trading stocks online, it is essential to understand what the costs are to buy and sell shares. Fortunately, today in 2020, most online brokers charge $0 to trade shares of stocks. That said, if <a href="/guides/day-trading">day trading</a>, additional costs come into play, including routing fees, market data fees, and platform fees.  </p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">What trading tools do online brokers offer?</h2>

<p>To trade stocks online successfully, some stock traders rely purely on their trading tools. Trading platforms come in one of three forms: desktop, web (browser), or mobile. Advanced charting, scanning, hotkeys, virtual trading, watch lists, ladder trading, Level II quotes, and backtesting are just a sampling of the features some brokers offer. To compare trading platform features, use the <a href="/compare">online brokerage comparison tool</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">Do online brokers offer more than just stocks and options trading?</h2>

<p>Are you only trading stocks online, or are you interested in ETFs, mutual funds, options, futures, and forex too? In the United States, different regulations are required for brokers who support more complex asset classes. For example, stocks, ETFs, and options are the most commonly offered, while forex trading is the least commonly offered.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">Does every online broker provide a mobile app?</h2>

<p>While every online broker offers a mobile app, quality varies widely. Managing a stock brokerage account on the go is certainly important for investors who travel and frequently use their smartphones. To find the <a href="/guides/mobile-trading">best app for stock trading</a>, we scored broker apps on 42 individual features.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">Should I care about customer service?</h2>

<p>It depends. 24/7 support is essential to some investors, while others may be completely fine using online chat during regular market hours or receiving an email back within one business day. That said, most investors neglect to think about a market crisis like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_crash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flash crash</a>. In our experience, it certainly doesn't hurt to have reliable customer service available for whenever the need may arise.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">How important is stock research?</h2>

<p>There are two types of stock research: fundamental and technical. Fundamental research explores company metrics such as earnings growth, earnings per share (EPS), debt, sales growth, and market capitalization. Meanwhile, technical analysis is all about learning how to read a stock chart and use historical price performance to help you predict future price direction. The best online brokerages offer tools to cover both types thoroughly, and we checked for 54 individual features during our 2020 Review. To compare research features, use the <a href="/compare">online brokerage comparison tool</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">How can I verify if my online broker is regulated?</h2>

<p>Online stock brokers operating in the United States and governed by US law are regulated by the SEC and must be members of <a href="https://www.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FINRA</a> and <a href="https://www.sipc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIPC</a>. To verify whether your online brokerage is regulated, scroll to the footer of their homepage, then read their disclosures. Using the <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FINRA broker check tool</a> is another easy way to verify compliance.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">Do online brokerages also offer banking services?</h2>

<p>Many online brokerages do not limit their customers to just online stock trading. Full-service brokerages offer banking services including checking accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, mortgages, and more with deposits of up to $250,000 backed by the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDIC</a>. Bank of America (<a href="/review/merrilledge">Merrill Edge</a>) and Chase (<a href="/review/chase-you-invest-trade">Chase You Invest Trade</a>) are two examples of banks that also offer online trading.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">Should I worry about security?</h2>

<p>Fortunately, at least in the United States, investors do not have too much to worry about when it comes to account security. This is especially true when choosing a brokerage that is large, well known, and properly regulated. Every website should be secured with <a href="https://www.digicert.com/ssl/" target="-blank">SSL encryption</a>, and client data should be stored in secure servers. Dual-factor authentication and Face ID are other security protocols quickly growing in popularity.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">With $0 trades, how important is order execution?</h2>

<p>It is important to understand how your orders are routed and executed. There is a wide variation between quality and poor order execution. Unfortunately, most online stock traders can't tell the difference. To help investors out, we tested brokers and wrote a complete guide to <a href="/guides/order-execution">understanding order execution</a>.</p>

<h2 class="h2-biggest">Can I trade internationally with my online broker?</h2>

<p>While most online brokers do not offer international trading, some do. Nearly every broker supports trading American depositary receipts (ADRs), which offers US investors an easy, simple way to invest in foreign companies. However, if you want to buy physical shares of an international company, then you need to do your research. Interactive Brokers is the leader in this space but is built for professionals. For casual investing, both <a href="/review/fidelityinvestments">Fidelity</a> and <a href="/review/charlesschwab">Charles Schwab</a> offer international stock trading.</p>
